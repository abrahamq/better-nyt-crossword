# Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should:

1. Be simple and recognizable at small sizes
2. Use a consistent design across all sizes
3. Be saved as PNG files with transparency
4. Represent the crossword/puzzle theme

## Suggested Design

Consider using:

- A crossword grid pattern
- The letters "NYT" stylized
- A puzzle piece
- A pencil/pen icon
- Clean, minimal design with good contrast

## Placeholder Icons

Until custom icons are created, you can use simple colored squares or find free icons from:

- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/)

Make sure any icons you use are properly licensed for your use case.
